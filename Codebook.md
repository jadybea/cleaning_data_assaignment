# CODEBOOK

## This is a codebook for a tidy data set that was created as an assignment of the Course project of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health on Coursera.

This assaignment required the cleaning of the data set found at

    "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip".
    
## INFORMATION ON ORIGINAL DATA

The following information about the dataset was provided by the authors: 

"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0

Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova. Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy. activityrecognition@smartlab.ws

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data." 

"The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

## INFORMATION ON THE TIDY DATA SET:

### Columns defining observations:

"subject" : id of the person peforming the activities. Range: 1:30.
"activity" : name of the activity the measuresments were performed for. There are 6 different activities such as 

* WALKING, 
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 
* SITTING, 
* STANDING, 
* LAYING.

The "subject" and "activity" together determines the "observation", i.e. an activity performed by a person. There are 30 x 6 = 180 different observations (rows) in the data set.

### Variables:

In the assignement, it was specified to select for the mean values and standard deviations of each measurement. Accordingly, I selected only the variables that are found in the following variable list. (Note that only the actual mean values were selected that were results of mathematical calculations during which a standard deviation was also calculated.)

Variable values are found  in the 3:68 columns of the tidy data sets. 

##### All variable values are normalised values ranging from -1 to +1.

### TRANSFORMATIONS

To obtain the tidy data set, I used six files of the original data set:
* y_test.txt
* y_train.txt
* subject_train.txt
* subject_test.txt
* X_train.txt
* X_test.txt. 

Using R studio on a Linux Ubuntu 32-bit system , I united the subject, y and X files for both training and test data, then I merged the datatables containing the test and training data. 

From the united data set, I selected the columns corresponding to observations, mean and standard variation values. 

I named the columns according to the codebook of the original data set. 

For the subsequent steps, I used the dplyr package. I ordered the data by the "subject" id and broke the ties with the "activity" in order to help readers to understand the organisation of the data better. 

For the "activity" column, I converted the codes of the activities to factor levels and I added the names of the activities as factor labels. 

By splitting the data according to the "subject" and "activity", the mean of each variable was calculated for each observation and stored in the tidy data set.
